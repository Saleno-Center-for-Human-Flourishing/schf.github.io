    "text": "Measurement of the two distinct components—scattering and absorption—of a single particle’s optical extinction provides fundamentally important and complementary information on how that object processes light: either scattering it back to the far-field or converting it into internal excitation. Yet measurement and separation of each is an extraordinarily difficult experimental task. Far-field optical spectroscopies and microscopies are also limited by diffraction, which further restricts the amount of information attainable. In spite of these constraints, we combine ideas from photothermal heterodyne imaging and plasmon-enhanced super-resolution imaging to correlate the absorption spectra of individual nanoscopic objects with their precise locations below the diffraction limit. Active far-field manipulation and control of the thermal near-field in engineered metamaterials extends this work in new directions that we are currently exploring in collaboration with multiple experimental teams."

We use video games to model philosophical, ethical, and moral dilemmas. Participation in this group will satisfy the credit requirements for PHIL 321. Phil 321 is an Immersive Experience credit course. Students who particpate in Phil 321 activities will earn 0.5 Units. This course offers students the opportunity to engage in immersive, philosophically relevant experiences outside the traditional classroom setting. Through approved activities such as philosophy reading groups, Ethics Bowl participation, or research apprenticeships, students will apply philosophical concepts in practical contexts, deepening their understanding and engagement with the discipline. Majors and Minors only."

Touching a hot pan’s lid provides a simple and all too familiar example of such thermal conduction. As a material’s size is reduced to 10-100s of nanometers, or about 1,000 times smaller than a human hair, depositing and maintaining thermal energy within a small region of space becomes even more challenging. Yet the ability to control heat flow and thus temperature at nanoscopic dimensions has important implications for applications ranging from data storage and local chemical reaction control to photothermal therapies for disease treatment and pain management through ion channel stimulation.\nWith support from the National Science Foundation Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) Program, Professor David J. Masiello from the University of Washington, Professor Katherine A. Willets from Temple University, and Professor Stephan Link from Rice University are developing methods to theoretically design and experimentally realize a new class of materials capable of controllably directing temperature increases to nanoscale regions of space using light. Beyond impacting a wide variety of applications, the project is also facilitating the interdisciplinary training of students and postdoctoral researchers through student exchange between the three research groups.",

    "text": "Simulating the Good Life\nMost important among the underlying comments of Platonic and Aristotelian views of rational self-sufficiency, is the view that art uniquely enables reflection on what amounts to a beautiful human life. Taking the concept of art and interpreting it broadly, MMOs fit this category. The difference here is that we intend to use MMOs as art in the pursuit of being able to reflect on a beautiful life. Consider the game One Hour One Life by Jason Rohrer. One Hour is a multiplayer survival game whose players must depend on other players in their early years. A player begins as a helpless baby and their continued play depends on the kindness of other players. However, the more individuals in a given community who can work well together, the better that community fairs in the long run. So the sacrifice that community members make in the early years of a member’s life, become an investment in the long run."

    "text": "Coupling between light and matter is extraordinarily weak. Optical resonator cavities provide an opportunity to coax repeated light-matter interactions, thereby enhancing coupling far beyond that of free space. In such settings, coupling can be so strong that it is no longer possible to disentangle the original optical and material degrees of freedom, resulting in non-equilibrium quantum optical states endowed with properties beyond those of their components. Together with experiment we develop theoretical models and simulation tools necessary to explicitly connect nanophotonic cavity + qubit systems with quantum many-body processes and phenomena. Our work not only enables the simulation of quantum many-body physics in nanophotonic devices but also provides opportunities to protect fragile quantum correlations against decoherence."
