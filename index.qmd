When combined with carefully selected reading materials, role-playing in virtual video-game environments can double as executable thought experiments. We use video games to model philosophical, ethical, and moral dilemmas. Participation in this group will satisfy the credit requirements for PHIL 321. Phil 321 is an Immersive Experience credit course. Students who particpate in Phil 321 activities will earn 0.5 Units. This course offers students the opportunity to engage in immersive, philosophically relevant experiences outside the traditional classroom setting. Through approved activities such as philosophy reading groups, Ethics Bowl participation, or research apprenticeships, students will apply philosophical concepts in practical contexts, deepening their understanding and engagement with the discipline.
Majors and Minors only.
