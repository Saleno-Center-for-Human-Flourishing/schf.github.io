The Philosophy Game Club at Stetson University invites Philosophy majors, minors, and the interested to join our weekly gatherings to discuss and play multiplayer video games like Star Citizen, Roblox, or others with robust communities that allow collaborative objectives.

Weâ€™re exploring ethical and other philosophical questions in gaming, such as whether a player who befriends another outside a game to gain secret in-game information, is cheating. Join us in person or virtually to discuss future meeting plans and suggest games like Minecraft or Eve Online.

* Contact: Dr. Montaque Reynolds (mreynolds1@stetson.edu)
* When: Fridays at 2:30 PM
* Where: Elizabeth Hall, Room 104 (Philosophy Department)
